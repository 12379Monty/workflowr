## Can I make my workflowr website private?

Short answer: No.

Long answer: Even if you create a private GitHub repository, the website it
creates is still public. If you're not ready to publish your results online, you
can always wait and activate GitHub Pages later. In the meantime, you'll still
have a version-controlled, organized set of results for your project. However,
the risk that someone that doesn't have the link to your website is able to find
it is very low. Search engines prioritize the results by how many other sites
link to a site, so your website will not be high in the results even if you
search for very specific terms. Thus if you only share the URL to your results
with your close collaborators, and request that they not share it widely, your
website is effectively private. That being said, being truly scooped in science
is rare (at best) and openly sharing your work will help establish your
expertise in the field (and furthermore establishes your priority), so you
should consider keeping both your code and website public.

## Can I include Shiny apps in my website?

No, at least not in the standard setup. The website is hosted with GitHub pages,
which only supports static web pages. Shiny apps are dynamic, i.e. a user can
interact with them to change the content. The easiest way to share your Shiny
app would be to host it at [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/) and add a
link to your app on your workflowr website. Alternatively you could host your
workflowr website on your own server, but that would require much more knowledge
and resources to accomplish.

## Can I change "X" on my website?

Almost certainly yes, but some things are easier to customize than others. The
vignette [Customize your research website](wflow-02-customization.html) provides
some ideas that are simple to implement. Check out the documentation for
[rmarkdown][] and [Twitter Bootstrap][Bootstrap] for inspiration.
