## Introduction

The [Getting Started vignette][vig-getting-started] provides instructions for
deploying the workflowr website using the service [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]
because it is quick and convenient. However, the static website created by
workflowr can be deployed using any strategy you like. Below are instructions
for deploying the workflowr website contributed by other workflowr users. If you
would like to contribute intructions for another deployment strategy, please
fork the [workflowr repository][workflowr] on GitHub and add your instructions to this file
on the "dev" branch. If you need any assistance with this, please don't hesitate
to open an [Issue][wflow-issues].
