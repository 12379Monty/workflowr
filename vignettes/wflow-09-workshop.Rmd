## Introduction

The [workflowr][] R package makes it easier for you to organize, reproduce, and
share your data analyses. This short tutorial will introduce you to the
workflowr framework. If you are completing this tutorial as part of a live
workshop, please follow the [setup instructions](#setup) in the next section prior to
arriving.

Workflowr combines literate programming with [R Markdown][rmd] and version
control with [Git][git] to generate a website containing time-stamped,
versioned, and documented results. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a
website hosted on [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] that contains the results of a
reproducible, statistical analysis.

[gh-pages]: https://pages.github.com/
[git]: https://git-scm.com/
[rmd]: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/
[workflowr]: https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr

## Setup

1. Install [R][r]

1. Install [RStudio][rstudio]

1. Install workflowr from [CRAN][cran]:

    ```r
    install.packages("workflowr")
    ```

1. Create an account on [GitHub][gh]

[cran]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=workflowr
[gh]: https://github.com
[r]: http://cran.r-project.org
[rstudio]: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

## Organized

To help you stay organized, workflowr creates a project directory with the
necessary configuration files as well as subdirectories for saving data and
other project files. This tutorial uses the [RStudio project
template][rstudio-proj-template] for workflowr, but note that the same can be
achieved via the function `wflow_start()`.

[rstudio-proj-template]: https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rstudio_project_templates.html

To start your workflowr project, follow these steps:

1. Open RStudio.

1. In the R console, run `wflow_git_config()` to register your name and email
with Git. This only has to be done once per computer. If you've used Git
on this machine before, you can skip this step. For a better GitHub experience,
use the same email as you used to register your GitHub account.

    ```{r config}
    library(workflowr)
    wflow_git_config(user.name = "First Last", user.email = "email@domain.com")
    ```

1. In the menu bar, choose `File` -> `New Project`.

1. Choose `New Directory` and then scroll down the list of project types to
select `workflowr project`.

1. Type `myproject` as the directory name, choose where to save it on
your computer, and choose `Create Project`.

1. RStudio executed `wflow_start()` to create the workflowr project `myproject`
and opened the project in RStudio. Note the workflowr directory structure
in the Files pane.

    ```
    myproject/
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .Rprofile
    ├── _workflowr.yml
    ├── analysis/
    │   ├── about.Rmd
    │   ├── index.Rmd
    │   ├── license.Rmd
    │   └── _site.yml
    ├── code/
    │   ├── README.md
    ├── data/
    │   └── README.md
    ├── docs/
    ├── myproject.Rproj
    ├── output/
    │   └── README.md
    └── README.md
    ```

1. Using the files pane, navigate to the directory `analysis/` and click on
`index.Rmd` to open it for editing. Write a short introductory message.

1. In the R console, run `wflow_build()`. This will build all the R Markdown
files in `analysis/`^[The default behavior when `wflow_build()` is run without
any arguments is to build any R Markdown file that has been edited since its
corresponding HTML file was last built.], save them in `docs/`, and then open
`docs/index.html` in the RStudio Viewer pane.

1. To perform your analysis, you will use a built-in data set from R.^[While not
the most exciting, this avoids any issues with downloading data from the
internet and saving it correctly.] The data set `ToothGrowth` contains the
length of the teeth for 60 guinea pigs given 3 different doses of vitamin C
either via orange juice (`OC`) or directly with ascorbic acid (`VC`). To
explore the data set, run the following in the R console.

    ```{r teeth, eval=TRUE}
    data("ToothGrowth")
    summary(ToothGrowth)
    str(ToothGrowth)
    ```

1. To mimic a real project that will have external data files, save the
`ToothGrowth` data set to the `data/` subdirectory using `write.csv()`.

    ```{r teeth-write}
    write.csv(ToothGrowth, file = "data/teeth.csv")
    ```

## Reproducible

To demonstrate the reproducibility features of workflowr, you will perform a
small analysis.

1. In the R console, open a new R Markdown file with `wflow_open()`. It will
open automatically for editing in RStudio.

    ```{r open}
    wflow_open("analysis/teeth.Rmd")
    ```

1. In the file `teeth.Rmd`, insert a code chunk^[You can insert a code chunk via
the menu bar, `Code` -> `Insert Chunk`, or using the keyboard shortcut
`Ctrl/Cmd`+`Alt`+`I`.] that imports the data set from the file you previously
created.

    ````
    ```{r import-teeth}`r ''`
    teeth <- read.csv("data/teeth.csv", row.names = 1)
    head(teeth)
    ```
    ````

1. In the file `teeth.Rmd`, insert a second chunk and create some boxplots to
explore the data:

    ````
    ```{r boxplots}`r ''`
    boxplot(len ~ dose, data = teeth)
    boxplot(len ~ supp, data = teeth)
    boxplot(len ~ dose + supp, data = teeth)
    ```
    ````

```{r test-boxplots, eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
data("ToothGrowth")
teeth <- ToothGrowth
boxplot(len ~ dose, data = teeth)
boxplot(len ~ supp, data = teeth)
boxplot(len ~ dose + supp, data = teeth)
```

1. To compare the tooth length of the guinea pigs given orange juice versus
those given vitamin C, you could perform a permutation-based statistical test.
This involves comparing the observed difference in teeth length due to the
supplement method to the observed differences calculated from random
permutations of the data. The basic idea is that if the observed difference is
an outlier compared to the differences generated after permuting the supplement
method column, it is more likely to be a true signal not due to chance alone.
Insert the code chunk below to demonstrate a permutation^[You won't implement
the full permutation method in this tutorial.]:

    ````
    ```{r permute}`r ''`
    # Observed difference in teeth length due to supplement method
    mean(teeth$len[teeth$supp == "OJ"]) - mean(teeth$len[teeth$supp == "VC"])
    # Permute the observations
    supp_perm <- sample(teeth$supp)
    # Caclculate mean difference in permuted data
    mean(teeth$len[supp_perm == "OJ"]) - mean(teeth$len[supp_perm == "VC"])
    ```
    ````

```{r test-permute, eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
# Observed difference in teeth length due to supplement method
mean(teeth$len[teeth$supp == "OJ"]) - mean(teeth$len[teeth$supp == "VC"])
# Permute the observations
supp_perm <- sample(teeth$supp)
# Caclculate mean difference in permuted data
mean(teeth$len[supp_perm == "OJ"]) - mean(teeth$len[supp_perm == "VC"])
```

1. In the R console, run `wflow_build()`. Note the value of the observed difference
in the permuted data.

1. In RStudio, click on the Knit button. Has the value of the observed difference
in the permuted data changed? It should be identical. This is because workflowr
always sets the same seed prior to running the analysis.^[Note that everyone in
the workshop will have the same result because by default workflowr uses a seed that
is the date the project was created as YYYYMMDD. You can change this by editing
the file `_workflowr.yml`.]

## Troubleshooting

1. I don't see the workflowr project as an available RStudio Project Type.

If you just installed workflowr, close and re-open RStudio.
Also, make sure you scroll down to the bottom of the list.
